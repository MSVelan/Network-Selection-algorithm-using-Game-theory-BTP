# Network-Selection-algorithm-using-Game-theory-BTP
This is the final year B.Tech IT project where I have done research work during Jan 2025 to June 2025. 
This research project uses Stackelberg Game theory algorithm in selecting the optimal network in a hybrid VLC-RF network for each user.
The system parameters and the utilities for the follower and the leader are designed by myself and the application of 
stackelberg game theory algorithm for this use case is also my original idea.

Here, the users are the follower while the network provider is the leader.
The leader anticipates the best response from the follower and chooses his best response.
